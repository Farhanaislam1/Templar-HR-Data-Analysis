Insights: Overall, the analysis reveals disparities in salaries based on gender and minority status for job types of level 2 or higher. While some differences exist, further exploration is needed to understand the intersectional dynamics and potential contributing factors.
Gender Comparison: On average, male employees earn a higher annual salary (`$89,857.09`) compared to female employees (`$83,155.57`) for job types of level 2 or higher, indicating a gender pay gap of approximately `$6,701.52`. Additionally, the analysis of salary percentiles reveals that male employees tend to have higher positions in the salary distribution, with the 75th percentile for males being notably higher than that for females. This suggests that while the mean salary difference is significant, the disparity is even more pronounced at higher salary levels.

Minority Status Comparison: 
Employees who do not identify as a visible minority earn a higher average salary (`$89,857.09`) compared to those who identify as a visible minority (`$85,261.66`) for job types of level 2 or higher, suggesting a disparity in average salary based on minority status of approximately `$4,595.43`. Further analysis of salary percentiles reveals that non-visible minority employees also tend to occupy higher percentiles in the salary distribution compared to visible minority employees. This indicates a potential discrepancy in the distribution of salaries between these two groups, with non-visible minority employees having a higher representation at higher salary levels.
Intersectional Analysis: Further investigation is warranted to understand the intersectionality of gender and minority status in salary disparities for job types level 2 or higher. Analyzing the combined effects of gender and minority status may reveal nuanced insights into pay discrepancies within the organization, particularly at different percentiles of the salary distribution.
These insights underscore the importance of addressing disparities in salaries based on gender and minority status and implementing strategies to promote pay equity and diversity within the organization. Further analysis and exploration of potential contributing factors can inform targeted interventions aimed at fostering a more inclusive and equitable workplace environment.
